** There is a demo login available from my Portfolio site

This site is a personal project made for myself and my wife to keep track of our recipes in a place where either of us can access them.

## Why?

I wanted to create a full CRUD application for a learning experience, specifically using NextJS and I wanted to create something that would be useful, not only to myself but also my wife. 

#3 Is because this the 3rd iteration of this idea. The original - also located here on Github, was my CS50 final project. That was made with Python. This site has been rebuilt from the ground up (while using the same Postgres DB) with NextJs

It is hosted on Vercel

## What?
### Built Using
* NextJS
* Tailwind CSS
* Postgresql
* Prisma (database orm)
* Next-Auth authentication and authorisaztion
* WYSIWYG Text Editor
* Real time search

## To Run Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
